        Our Journey
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <span className="font-semibold text-2xl">sutta.com</span> was born from
        a simple idea and a bold vision: to be more than just a place to buy
        cigarettes, but a community built on shared experiences. Our roots trace
        back to late-night conversations, smoke-filled gatherings, and whispered
        stories exchanged in dimly lit spaces. This isn't merely about selling a
        product; it's about capturing a lifestyle, a culture.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Our founders lived and breathed this world. They recognized a need for a
        dedicated space where enthusiasts could connect, find high-quality
        products, and discover a premium experience. From that insight,{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-2xl">sutta.com</span> took shape.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        For us, a cigarette is more than just a simple indulgence - it's a
        ritual. Each product featured on our site is carefully chosen, each
        detail crafted to enhance that experience. We see our offerings not just
        as items but as symbols of a choice, an identity, a moment shared.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Today, <span className="font-semibold text-2xl">sutta.com</span>{" "}
        continues to grow, but our mission holds steady. We champion quality,
        celebrate authenticity, and embrace our customers as a vital part of our
        journey. We are more than a store - we're a place where you belong,
        where your choices and stories find a home.

        Welcome to <span className="font-semibold text-2xl">sutta.com</span> -
